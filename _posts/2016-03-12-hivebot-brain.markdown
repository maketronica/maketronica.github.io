I've been working up to this for a while, and it's finally coming together,
and not a moment too soon. The bees will be arriving in a little over a month
and I've still got a lot of work to do.

I bought the precut boards to make a shallow box to put on top of the beehive
to keep the core electronics in.

Then I inserted some 1/8" wire mesh into the bottom of the box to allow airflow
but to keep the bees out of the electronics.  I don't want them coating the
Raspberry Pi and Arduino in propolis.  

For now, I'm putting the first temperature and humidity sensor on a breadboard
while I'm still figuring out how I want everything placed.
