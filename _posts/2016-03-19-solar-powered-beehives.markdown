Today I ran solar power to our two beehives to run the Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos,
and environmental sensors.

I ran low voltage outdoor lighting wire from the solar panels to junction boxes
under each hive. On the end of the wire that ran to the solar panels, I atteched
one half of a USB cable to plug in to the usb port on the solar charge controller.

I ran another cable from each juntion box up to the electronics box on the
beehives and attached the other (micro) end of the USB cables to it to plug in
to the Raspberry Pis.
