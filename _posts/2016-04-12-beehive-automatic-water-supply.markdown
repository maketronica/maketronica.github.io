I recently made an automatically refilling water supply for our two beehives.

When keeping bees in an urban setting, it’s important to make sure they have a
reliable source of water. One way or another, they’ll find water, and I wanted
to try to provide our bees with an option more preferable than a neighborhood
swimming pool or bird bath.

Parts List:

* [Planter](http://amzn.to/1YstR0r)
* [Float Valve](http://amzn.to/1YstT8v)
* [Tubing](http://amzn.to/23sJnjP)

I disassembled the float so that I could figure out what size drill bit to use.
I needed a hole just big enough to fit the one end of the float through, and no
bigger. It turned out that my half inch drill bit was just a little too small,
but the next size up I had was too big.

So I used my too-small bit to drill a hole in the side of the planter, and then
grabbed a file to make the whole just a little bigger, trying to be careful to
keep the hole round, with limited success. Once the hole was big enough, I
stuck the float through from the inside and reassembled it.

Then I attached the ¼” tubing, the other end of which will simply plug into our
drip irrigation system.

And then I put in a bunch of rocks, and took it out to our hives.  If you do
this, I recommend taking it out to the hives, and <strong>then</strong>putting
in a bunch of rocks.

Next I hooked it up to water, and tested it out. It filled up just fine, but
then I noticed that it was leaking pretty good right where the float attached
to the planter.

I drained it all out and inspected things, and that’s when I realized that a
support structure on the planter was causing the float to sit a little crooked
and not seal properly. So I used a knife to trim that piece down a bit, and
then tried filling it up again.  This time there were no leaks.

I piled the rocks into a bit of an island near the center of the planter, and
then stuck a bunch of sticks (some of which I borrowed from our neighbor’s
cherry tree) into the rocks to give the bees another way to crawl down to the
water and back out again.

With the rock island and the sticks, I hope that it won’t matter what level the
water is at (as long as it’s not empty). The bees should always have a few
options to get to the surface comfortably, without needing to take a swim. 

However there’s one very minor problem still. I can’t seem to position the
planter such that the float properly turns the water on and off. Our yard isn't
completely level, and when the end of the plant with the float is a little high,
the water continues to trickle in very very slowly, until the planter starts to
overflow. However, if I raise the other end of the planter up just a little bit,
the float will turn off the water when the planter is full, but then never turn
the water back on again when the lever drops.

Maybe there are some adjustments I can make to make it work better. However,
since this will be attached to a drip irrigation system on a timer, I’m not too
worried about it occasionally overfilling.  That seems to help drain out
floaters that get blown in by the wind anyway. If you have any ideas for how to
improve on this though, please leave a comment below.
