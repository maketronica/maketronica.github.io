<p>
  The Maketronica Hivebot is a collection of hardware and (predominantely)
  open-source software installed in the beehive in our back yard, with the
  purpose of tracking environmental conditions whithin and around the hives,
  as well as provide instructional material so that others may possibly
  apply some of what I've done to their own beehive, or beer fridge, or
  whatever maker project they have in mind.
</p>

<h2>Chart</h2>
<p>
  Here's a sample chart of live data coming from the current hivebots (probably
  installed in the hives, but if the values look way off, one or both may be
  in my office getting a makeover. Soon, there should be a link right here 
  somewhere to a page with a bunch more charts.

<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>
  I'll be putting together a bunch of videos details the process of setting up
  each of the sensors within the beehives on my 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCulAke49TbCNr6xI16g8dBQ">MakeTronica YouTube channel</a>.
</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
  The following is a list of open-source sofware I've written that, as a 
  collection, provides all of the hivebot functionality.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Although the code is open-source, I am currently only working on it
  to serve my own purposes.</strong> You are free to download it, modify it,
  and try to get it working on your own beehives and hardware, but I'm not
  likely be be able to provide any support or assistance at this time.
</p>
<p>
  To get all of the pieces working together, you want to, at a bare minimum,
  consider yourself proficient at reading and running Ruby applications, basic
  networking, electronics assembly and soldering (for the sensors),
  troubleshooting, and self-sufficient problem solving.

<h3>hivebot.avr</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/maketronica/hivebot.avr">hivebot.avr</a> is the
  code for the Arduino in each hive. The Arduino has several sensors and the
  sensor data is sent over a USB serial connection to a Raspberry Pi, also in
  the hive, for transmission back to the house.
</p>
<p>
  The original plan was to have everything running off of Arduinos, but I ran
  into too many problems consistently transmitting the data back to the house,
  that I eventually moved some stuff to Raspberry Pis. The Ardunio's may
  eventually be retired in favor of attaching all sensors directly to the Pis,
  but that remains to be seen.
</p>

<h3>hivebot.rb</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/maketronica/hivebot.rb">hivebot.rb</a> is the
  Ruby code that runs on a Raspberry Pi in each beehive. It reads data over the
  USB serial connection from the Arduino, and then transmits it over our WiFi
  network to hivemom.rb, running on another Raspberry Pi in the house.
</p>
<p>
  Each Raspberry Pi is running a recent (as of the time I installed it) version
  of <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/">Ubuntu Mate.</a>
</p>
<h3>hivemom.rb</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/maketronica/hivemom.rb">hivemom.rb</a> is the
  Ruby code running on a Pi back in the house. It's a simple HTTP RACK app
  that receives RESTful posts from each hivebot.rb, stores the data in a
  local database, writes out .csv files for hivedash.csv, and pushes copies
  of the .csv files up to Amazon S3 to enable generating the demo charts on 
  this website (www.maketronica.com).

<h3>hivedash.jkyl</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/maketronica/hivedash.jkyl">hivedash.jkyl</a> is
  a static <a href='https://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> website served from
  the same Raspberry Pi that Hivemom runs on to generate graphs of sensor
  data.
